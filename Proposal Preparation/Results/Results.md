[[kNN SD2.1 - Spatial Domain - Batch Size Analysis]]
##### Summary
Batch size doesn't have direct impact on the accuracy of the detection as long as the number of images is just enough.

#### Phase vs Magnitude
[[kNN SD1.5 - Frequency Domain - Phase vs Magnitude Analysis]]
##### Summary
We conclude that we can build an assumption upon this that the magnitude holds more important features than the phase.
