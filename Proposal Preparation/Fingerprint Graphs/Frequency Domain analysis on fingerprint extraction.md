### Magnitude
We assume that the magnitude of the residuals is much more important than the magnitude of the denoised images, as after the denoising process there is a big similarity between real images and denoised ones in the magnitude.

### Phase 
By numbers and various graphs we investigated the phase and its effect on the classification and it was found to be misleading.
